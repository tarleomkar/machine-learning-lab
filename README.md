Machine Learning Laboratory Experiments
This repository contains a collection of laboratory experiments and assignments related to machine learning, implemented in Python. Each experiment covers a different technique or algorithm, and provides practical experience with data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

1. Data Preprocessing Operations 🧹
CO Mapped: CO1

Perform the following operations on the given dataset:

a) Importing the required libraries 📚
b) Importing the dataset from a file 📂
c) Handling of missing data 🕳️
d) Handling of categorical data ⚙️
e) Splitting the dataset into training and testing datasets 🎯
f) Feature scaling to normalize data 📏
Example Dataset:

Region	Age	Income	Online Shopper
India	49	86400	No
Brazil	32	57600	Yes
USA	35	64800	No
Brazil	43	73200	No
USA	45	99600	Yes
India	40	69600	Yes

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 📉
CO Mapped: CO2

Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the variance across principal components.

3. Linear Regression ➖
CO Mapped: CO3

Implement Linear Regression on a dataset to predict a target variable. This experiment helps understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) ⚖️
CO Mapped: CO3

Design and implement SVM for Classification. Test the model for Accuracy and Precision using a proper dataset.

5. Naïve Bayes Classifier 🔮
CO Mapped: CO3

Implement the Naïve Bayes Classifier for classification on a dataset. This experiment helps to understand probabilistic classifiers and their performance.

6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier 🔍
CO Mapped: CO3

Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier on a dataset. Evaluate the model for Accuracy and Precision to measure its effectiveness.

7. K-Means Clustering 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
CO Mapped: CO4

Implement the K-Means Clustering algorithm on a dataset to group data points into clusters. This helps in unsupervised learning.

8. K-Medoid Clustering 🏅
CO Mapped: CO4

Implement K-Medoid Clustering on the dataset. Like K-Means, but uses actual data points as centers (medoids), making it more robust to outliers.

9. Hierarchical Clustering 🏞️
CO Mapped: CO4

Implement Hierarchical Clustering to generate a hierarchy of clusters using a given dataset. Visualize the hierarchical structure with a Dendrogram.

10. Apriori Algorithm 🔍
CO Mapped: CO5

Implement the Apriori Algorithm to find frequently occurring items in a dataset and generate strong association rules using support and confidence thresholds.
